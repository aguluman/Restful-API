# RESTful-API 

It is an api that checks if the websites passed are up and running, if they are we get a response.

This is the RESTful api created as i learnt from PIPRLE node.js master course on udemy.

The course taught a lot on node.js in-built frameworks to its students. 

Such as the inbuilt http workers in node.js runtime.

As well as constructing a cli using only node.js
